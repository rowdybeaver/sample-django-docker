### What a production docker-compose file might look like
#   The build-live.sh script creates the images that are referenced here.
#   An nginx container (httpd) is added to serve as a reverse proxy and to handle the static files.
#   There is a 'cmd' container that applies migrations and only runs once.

## Note the ':ro' suffix for the media volumne on the httpd container,
## as it does not get access to update those files.
## Media files would probably be stored on a more persistent volume
## For this example, we will tell Docker manage it for us.
